Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding extra credit. percentage:: A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as \"40%\". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100% are allowed, for awarding extra credit. letter grade:: A letter grade, following the assignment's defined letter grading scheme. For example, \"A-\". The resulting score will be the high end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if \"B\" is defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of \"B\" will be worth 86%. The letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in points or percentage rather than the letter grade. \"pass/complete/fail/incomplete\":: A string value of \"pass\" or \"complete\" will give a score of 100%. \"fail\" or \"incomplete\" will give a score of 0. Note that assignments with grading_type of \"pass_fail\" can only be assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points_possible, nothing inbetween.

This parameter can be passed in a few different formats: points:: A floating point or integral value, such as \"13.5\". The grade will be interpreted directly as the score of the assignment. Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding extra credit. percentage:: A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as \"40%\". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100% are allowed, for awarding extra credit. letter grade:: A letter grade, following the assignment's defined letter grading scheme. For example, \"A-\". The resulting score will be the high end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if \"B\" is defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of \"B\" will be worth 86%. The letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in points or percentage rather than the letter grade. \"pass/complete/fail/incomplete\":: A string value of \"pass\" or \"complete\" will give a score of 100%. \"fail\" or \"incomplete\" will give a score of 0. Note that assignments with grading_type of \"pass_fail\" can only be assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points_possible, nothing inbetween. If a posted_grade in the \"points\" or \"percentage\" format is sent, the grade will only be accepted if the grade equals one of those two values.",
